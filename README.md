## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

This project was a great way to practice my knowledge of **Flexbox** and creating responsive layouts. I learned how to properly align items using **Flexbox** to create a responsive card component that looks good on all screen sizes.

For example, I used `display: flex;` and `flex-direction: column;` for smaller screens to stack elements vertically, and for larger screens, I used `flex-direction: row;` to align elements horizontally.

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}

```
### Continued development

In future projects, I plan to continue experimenting with Sass and CSS custom properties (variables) to manage styles more efficiently and keep the code cleaner. I would also like to explore more advanced responsive design techniques.
